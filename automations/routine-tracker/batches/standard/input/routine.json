  "notes":"- After the first trimester, avoid any exercises that require you to lie flat out on your back (supine), as this can add pressure to your uterus and the vein that flows blood back to the heart\n- Avoid working out for prolonged periods in the heat and make sure to hydrate accordingly.\n- If the weight rack is your normal go-to at the gym, or likewise, you love to work up a sweat on the treadmill, in most cases it's safe to continue unless indicated otherwise by a health care provider. Although as a caution, it's not advisable to introduce anything new into your fitness routine at this stage which may lead to unwanted injuries or added strain on the body.",
